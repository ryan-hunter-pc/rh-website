# An unconventional path

Although I've had a clear passion for technology for the majority of my life,
my journey to becoming a software developer was certainly not the usual one.

## The Oregon Trail

Like most people in my generation, I started by playing The Oregon Trail in the computer lab
in elementary school. First on the Power Macintosh, then on the iMac when it came out.

Following that, my middle and high school years were filled with building my own PC's from parts,
repairing computers for friends and family, customizing MySpace profiles, and a lot of gaming.

## Musical Technology

Starting in 5th grade, another passion of mine was music. I played trumpet in multiple school bands,
and by sophomore year in high school it was my primary focus. By my junior year I had made it into
a special extra-curricular jazz band which included highlight performances such as Dizzy's Club at
the Lincoln Center in New York City, and The North Sea Jazz Festival at The Hague in Amsterdam.

Once in college, studying music performance, I started gaining interest in music production
and audio engineering, likely because it brought two of my biggest passions together: music and tech.
Inspired by a single music technology class, I taught myself MIDI orchestration,
and used my computer-building experience to build a home studio capable of producing fully orchestrated
film scores out of my college bedroom. This made me quite popular amongst film students.

## Meanwhile, a Quick Dabble in C++

Also during college, my latent interest in programming finally came to a head, and I purchased
*Sam's Teach Yourself C++ in One Hour a Day*. Within a week, I had written a command-line program
which would simulate any combination of dice rolls for the game Dungeons and Dragons.

With some guidance from a few friends in the computer science department, I wrote several other
equally vital programs, and thus began my coding career.

Then, 

It starts off relatively similarly to how I imagine most tech geeks in my age group grew up:

**~1996** - Playing *The Oregon Trail* on Power Macintosh in the school computer lab.

**~1998** - Opened my first Hotmail account. "Viral" email chains such as
"Forward this to 10 friends within 5 minutes or your crush will hate you forever".

**2002** - My first very own desktop computer, at age 14. It even had this new lightning-fast
internet connection that worked over cable instead of phone lines.
I became a Napster-downloading CD-burning machine for all of my friends and family.

**2003** - Joined MySpace. Got my first taste of "code", by using a custom theme
generator which gave you a code snippet to paste into your profile to customize the font and colors.

## A Passion Awakens

**2004** - For the first time, I decided to replace the RAM in my computer myself.
I ordered two new sticks of RAM off an up-and-coming online computer parts store called Newegg,
found an online guide, and soon enough my computer was fixed and the extra RAM made it noticeably faster.

**2005** - Started gaming. Upgraded more parts. And then upgraded some more.

**2006** - Built a new desktop myself, entirely with parts ordered from Newegg.

## 


One day, the hard drive on my desktop failed. We took it in to get it replaced, back to the
computer shop that originally built it and sold it to my parents.
It was there I saw the inside of a computer case for the first time, and my mind was blown.
Electronics weren't just boxes of magic, there were parts inside that could be replaced just like in a car.

A couple years later, the RAM started failing on the same computer. This time, I wanted to
try it myself. I found this new website called Newegg, which sold computer parts.
I found an online guide which explained everything about how to replace RAM, with pictures.
With a surprisingly little amount of effort, and a lot of saved allowance, I had not only
fixed my computer, but I had quadrupled the amount of RAM in it.

That's when the addiction began. I discovered PC games, which meant I needed a video card.
Then, games started coming on DVD'd instead of CD's, so I had to upgrade to a DVD/CD combo drive.
Eventually, the motherboard failed. By this time, I was sixteen, and working as a projectionist
at a local movie theater, so my DIY confidence was at an all-time high.
